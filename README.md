## Introduction
Superstore, a medium-sized store that sells a wide range of products might just need insights into their business beyond the superficial; beyond what their intution can tell them. The goal of this analysis is to glean data-driven insights from the Superstore dataset at hand, and recommend 'so what' steps to take in redefining their sales story. This analysis makes a clear-cut dissection of the trend and pattern that concerns different aspects of the Superstore business. Key metrics including profit, revenue growth, product demand and supply, sales among others were explored and their deductions, captured for conclusions. In summary, here is a string of steps to tell a compelling story to optimize the performance of Superstore analysis.
